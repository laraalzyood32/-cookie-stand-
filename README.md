User Stories :
As a user, I want a webpage that displays individual store data for my Salmon Cookie Shops, so that I can be informed about how to run my business
As a developer, I want to represent the store data in a list format on the webpage, so my client can view the information
As a developer, I want to use object for each shop   to build this site, so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand


New repository properly set up with a license and README, and cloned to local machine
Good use of Object Literals , one for each store model; properties/values and methods are correctly constructed and given meaningful names
Main page meets requirements of the problem domain
Use template literals in your JS logic to render the stores as lists on the sales page

As a developer, I want to make some headway on the public-facing page for the business by generating a low-fidelity wireframe of what I want the page to look like.

Getting Started
You are making five object literals in your JavaScript today. Consider what would be an efficient process for building those out.
You have starting data, and a goal of end data that includes both arrays and single values. Think about what arrays you might need and also how you will use object methods to do your calculations.
